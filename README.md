# tevoklipper

Forked from:https://github.com/fl0r1s/cr10_klipper
with config imported from my working klipper config 

Machine is a tevo tornado with replacement bed made from a glass cutting board, leveling springs removed replaced with printed columns for rigidity. Control board is a SKR 1.3 with TMC2208 drivers on all motors. ABL is via a BLtouch mounted to the left side of the hotend. 

Extruder has been converted to direct extrusion with factory hotend using the petsfang titan direct conversion.
